# Ramulator & DRAM Bender Tutorial @ ICS 2026

Official website for the **Ramulator & DRAM Bender Tutorial: Cutting-Edge Infrastructures for Real and Future Memory System Evaluation**, held in conjunction with [ICS 2026](https://dipsa-qub.github.io/ICS2026-webpage) in Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK.

## 🗓️ Important Dates

- **Tutorial Date:** July 6, 2026

## 📋 About the Tutorial

DRAM is predominantly used to build the main memory systems of modern computing devices. To improve performance, reliability, and security, it is critical to conduct both system-level simulation studies and experimental characterization of cutting-edge DRAM chips. 

This tutorial+workshop will introduce simulation-based DRAM research together with experimental DRAM characterization using real DRAM chips. Participants will gain practical experience with two widely used infrastructures in industry and academia:

- **Ramulator**: A cycle-accurate and extensible main memory simulator
- **DRAM Bender**: An FPGA-based DRAM testing infrastructure
